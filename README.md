# React app

This website is a simple music app based on iTunes which I created to learn React.

## Instalation

You need to have [NPM](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) package manager to install all dependencies. Then go to root of the project and type in the console:

```bash
npm install
```

To start the localhost server you need to run command:

```bash
npm start
```
